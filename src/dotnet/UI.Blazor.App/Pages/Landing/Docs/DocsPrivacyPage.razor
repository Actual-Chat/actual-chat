    <h2>Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age</h2>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 16 through our Service, although
        certain third party websites that we link to may do so. These third-party websites have their own terms of use
        and privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage
        and instruct their children to never provide information on other websites without their permission.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not sell the personal information of Consumers We actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless We
        receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16
        years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to the
        sale of personal information may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, You
        (or Your authorized representative) may submit a request to Us by contacting Us.
    </p>
    <p>
        If You have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 (or 16) has provided Us with personal
        information, please contact Us with sufficient detail to enable Us to delete that information.
    </p>
