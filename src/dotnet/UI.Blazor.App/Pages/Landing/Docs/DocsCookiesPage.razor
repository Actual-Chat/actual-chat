    <h1>Cookies</h1>
    <p>Last updated: January 18, 2023</p>
    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Most websites use cookies to improve your user experience by enabling that website to ‘remember’ you, either
        for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).
    </p>
    <p>
        Cookies do many different things. They allow you to navigate between website pages efficiently, store your
        preferences and generally improving your experience of any website. Cookies make the interaction between you
        and the website faster and easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you visit any web site, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of
        cookies. This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the
        site work as you expect it to. The information does not usually directly identify you, but it can give you a
        more personalized web experience. Because we respect your right to privacy, you can choose not to allow some
        types of cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the site and the
        services we are able to offer.
    </p>

    <h1 id="whats-in">Whats in a cookie?</h1>
    <p>
        A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website’s server and only
        that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each cookie is unique to your web
        browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some
        digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what is in your shopping
        basket.
    </p>

    <h1 id="how-to-set">What to do if you do not want cookies to be set</h1>
    <p>
        Some people find the idea of a website storing information on their computer or mobile device intrusive,
        particularly when this information is stored and used by a third party without them knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although this is generally quite harmless you may not, for example, want to see advertising that has been
        targeted to your interests. If you prefer, it is possible to block some or all cookies or even to delete
        cookies that have already been set; but you need to be aware that you might lose some functions of that website.
    </p>

    <h1 id="control">How can I control cookies?</h1>
    <p>
        If you do not want to receive cookies, you can modify your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are
        sent to it or you can refuse cookies altogether. You can also delete cookies that have already been set.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wish to restrict or block web browser cookies which are set on your device then you can do this through
        your browser settings. You may wish to visit aboutcookies.org which contains comprehensive information on how
        to do this on a wide variety of desktop browsers.
