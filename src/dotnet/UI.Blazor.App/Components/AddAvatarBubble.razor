        Avatars are your "looks" in different chats - e.g. you can use different avatars for your work & family chats.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each avatar has distinct name, photo, and bio.</li>
        <li>You can use a distinct avatar in each chat.</li>
        <li>Some chats can be joined anonymously - avatars there are always randomly generated.</li>
    </ul>
