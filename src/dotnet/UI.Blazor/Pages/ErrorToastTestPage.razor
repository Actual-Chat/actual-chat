        To call, to text, or
        to voice message?
        But... Could these options be purely artificial?
        Is it possible to create a medium, which naturally combines all of them together?

        We are here to redefine the meaning of "Chat".
    </div>
    <div>
        We used to speak, laugh, and cry
        But now we text, "like", and send emojis.

        It's slower, inconvenient, and less expressive.

        With all the progress in technology and AI,
        how it happened that we can't just talk in chats?
    </div>
    <div>
        We reimagine calls, texts and voice messages
        By blending voice and text into a single medium.

        Watch your words come to life as you talk - anything you say is transcribed and instantly available, word-by-word.

        And it's not just a transcript - it's voice + text, streamed in real time. Listen to chats like a call, without the need for a call.

        Effortlessly catch up on missed moments - every conversation is captured in text and audio for later playback or reading.

        At the moment, Actual Chat is entirely free for personal use, and we intend to keep it that way. However, we do plan to generate revenue from commercial usage and a small subset of advanced features we plan to add in near future.

        So, if you're using Actual Chat for your personal communication needs, you can rest assured that there won't be any changes to the pricing.
