Pay close attention to what you see here. 

Yes, it's choosing between two stupid answers, solving a f@cking captcha, and "play mini-games and relax"!

**According to Google, this is the #1 solution to a real problem most of us face every day.<br/><br/>And 3.8 stars is an ok rating!**

<h1>What about audio messages ðŸ“§?<h1>

<!-- _class: highlight -->

- Transcripts are overrated. Learn to read the barcodes!
- ðŸ“§ Stop recording to "send" it. You can't use audio messages to talk in real-time.
- ðŸŽ§ No listen mode: the player stops once it reaches the end, it won't auto-play any new voice messages. BUT it doesn't stop when you start recording!
- No audio time span concept. So no matter how many people talk simultaneously, you hear them in order (at best).
- No text-to-speech, no context change detection to auto-stop recording, etc...

So:
â˜Ž = talk + demand other party to answer
ðŸ“§ = no demand, but you have to type it

That's why calling or receiving calls is a stressful activity for a fair share of population.

**But do you really have to choose?**

<h3>And there are plenty of other issues:</h2>

- Phone numbers & address book are so ðŸ¦ 
- Voice Mail = ðŸ¤®, Google Voice = a plumbing.
  **I want real-time transcripts!**
- No transcripts by default = no history
- Group calls ðŸ’© so badly that only experts know how to start them.

Finally, **"call" itself is a 145-years old concept 
invented to keep the parties wire-connected!**

<h3>Largely the same issues:</h2>

- No calls, but creating the meeting & sharing the link = even more friction for ad-hoc meetings
- You either join or miss it completely
- No recording by default, no transcript retained
- No way to easily review what's happened if you join late
- No built-in way to follow-up once it ends
- Lots of people would rather prefer just audio
- Do you really bother to see all these faces, or just the one(s) talking?

<h1>Is there a solution?<br/>
Yes, we're building one!<h1>

<h2>Actual.chat</h2>

We're sick of seeing how all these issues with calls & texts are duct-taped by every product on the market. That's why we re-imagine online communication completely.

- **Use voice, text, or both,** and seamlessly switch between these modes. Any piece of content is text + audio/video, the "counterpart" is generated in real-time.
- **No "call" concept** - any conversation is always asynchronous, but it becomes synchronous when you respond in real-time
- **You, not the other party, decide** whether you want to read or listen, to talk or type, to respond right now, later, or never.
- **Chat history matters,** and existing products somehow ignore this aspect completely. We know how to deliver an amazing experience here.
- **Privacy matters,** though we'd rather focus on killing spam by providing built-in anonymity in B2C/group communication vs things like E2E encryption in SSL era.

Think you saw something similar? Name a product, where:
- You see a transcript for whatever you tell
- And you can replay a recording behind the transcript
- What about playing from a certain word (that's seemingly wrongly transcribed)?
- Or seeing N play points moving in-sync through the text because N people were talking simultaneously?
- What about deleting a transcribed message & seeing the matching part of the audio was cut?
- Or editing a message & seeing the audio is edited too? And the new content is read using your own voice?
<br/>

The truth is: **no one dared to implement this.**
We do.
