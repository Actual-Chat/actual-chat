Pay close attention to what you see here.

<h1>What about audio messages ðŸ“§?<h1>

<!-- _class: highlight -->

![bg left:31%](./img/telegram-voice-messages.jpg)

- Transcripts are overrated. Learn to read the barcodes!
- ðŸ“§ Stop recording to "send" it. You can't use audio messages to talk in real-time.
- ðŸŽ§ No listen mode: the player stops once it reaches the end, it won't auto-play any new voice messages. BUT it doesn't stop when you start recording!
- No audio time span concept. So no matter how many people talk simultaneously, you hear them in order (at best).
- No text-to-speech, no context change detection to auto-stop recording, etc...

So:
â˜Ž = talk + demand other party to answer
ðŸ“§ = no demand, but you have to type it

That's why calling or receiving calls is a stressful activity for a fair share of population.

**But do you really have to choose?**

<!-- _class: highlight -->

![bg left:34%](./img/call-screen.jpg)

<h3>And there are plenty of other issues:</h2>

- Phone numbers & address book are so ðŸ¦ 
- Voice Mail = ðŸ¤®, Google Voice = a duct tape.
  **Where is my real-time transcript?**
- No transcripts by default = no history
- Group calls are so ðŸ’© that only experts know how to start them.

Finally, **"call" itself is a 145-years old concept 
invented to keep the parties wire-connected!**

<h3>Largely the same issues:</h2>

- No calls, but creating the meeting & sharing the link = even more friction for ad-hoc meetings
- You either join or miss it completely
- No recording by default, no transcript retained
- No way to easily review what's happened if you join late
- No built-in way to follow-up once it ends
- Lots of people would rather prefer just audio
- Do you really bother to see all these faces, or just the one(s) talking?

<h1>Is there a solution?<br/>

<h2>Actual.chat</h2>

We're sick of seeing how all these issues with calls & texts are duct-taped by every product on the market. That's why we re-imagine online communication completely.

- **Use voice, text, or both,** and seamlessly switch between these modes. Any piece of content is text + audio/video, the "counterpart" is generated in real-time.
- **No "call" concept** - any conversation is always asynchronous, but it becomes synchronous when you respond in real-time
- **You, not the other party, decide** whether you want to read or listen, to talk or type, to respond right now, later, or never.
- **Chat history matters,** and existing products somehow ignore this aspect completely. We know how to deliver an amazing experience here.
- **Privacy matters,** though we'd rather focus on killing spam by providing built-in anonymity in B2C/group communication vs things like E2E encryption in SSL era.

<!-- _class: highlight -->

Think you saw something similar? Name a product, where:
- You see a transcript for whatever you tell
- And you can replay a recording behind the transcript
- What about playing from a certain WORLD (a wrongly transcribed one)?
- Or seeing N play points moving in-sync through the text because N people were talking simultaneously?
- What about deleting a part of the transcribed message (e.g. a credit card number) & seeing the matching part of the audio is gone too?
- Or editing a message & seeing the audio is edited too? And the new content is read using your own voice?
<br/>

The truth is: **no one dared to implement this.**
We do.

<h3>Why messaging kings won't do this?</h3>

- Every message in every chat app you know = a dot on the timeline
- The experience described above requires it to be a span + a fair amount of extra
- The upload, download & playback logic should be redesigned to work in "streaming + blob" rather than "blob only" mode
- 1 message per user per minute vs 20 messages per user per second (1200x more) = very different scalability assumptions. So your whole processing pipeline needs to be updated.

In fact, this is closer to Google Meet or Zoom than to a regular chat app. But they also miss a number of critical components &ndash; they're designed for streaming only, there is no "replay like if it's happening now" concept, no history, etc.

**The gist: if you're WhatsApp, Discord, or Slack, you need a major redesign to deliver this experience. And if you know how big companies operate, you know they're 10x more likely to buy you vs take the "major redesign" path.**

<h3>Our long-term vision is... Crazy:</h3>

<div style="text-align: center">

<h3>We want to:</h3>

- Create a platform + app providing the best communication experience:
- Start marketing it to SBM & regular people relying mainly on network effects:
  - Message anyone from your address book in the app - if they don't have Actual.chat account yet, they'll get a link to a dedicated communication channel (a web page) allowing them to talk, register, and download our mobile app.
  - Eventually - get a phone number routed to Actual.chat - whoever calls it gets a similar response + whatever they tell is available in real-time your Actual.chat app; you can even respond right there.
  - Discord-style places is a big part of this too.

---
<!-- _class: highlight -->
<h3>We want to:</h3>

Implement Twilio integration + an open API allowing any B2C company to switch to Actual.chat as their primary customer communication channel.

For the note, existing software simply doesn't deliver here:
- We'll retain every bit of communication w/ every customer
- You'll be able to respond by phone...
