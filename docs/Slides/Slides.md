Pay close attention to what you see here. 

Yes, it's choosing between two stupid answers, solving a f@cking captcha, and "play mini-games and relax"!

**According to Google, this is the #1 solution to a real problem most of us face every day.<br/><br/>And 3.8 stars is an ok rating!**

<h1>What about audio messages ðŸ“§?<h1>

---
<!-- _class: highlight -->

![bg left:31%](./img/telegram-voice-messages.jpg)

- Transcripts are overrated. Learn to read the barcodes!
- ðŸ“§ Stop recording to "send" it. You can't use audio messages to talk in real-time.
- ðŸŽ§ No listen mode: the player stops once it reaches the end, it won't auto-play any new voice messages. BUT it doesn't stop when you start recording!
- No audio time span concept. So no matter how many people talk simultaneously, you hear them in order (at best).
- No text-to-speech, no context change detection to auto-stop recording, etc...

<h3>Long story short...</h2>

Choose your poison:
  - â˜Ž: voice + demand to answer
  - ðŸ“§: no demand, no voice.

**But do you really have to choose?**

<h3>Other issues with phone calls</h2>

- Phone numbers & address book are so ðŸ¦ 
- Voice Mail = ðŸ¤®, Google Voice = a plumbing.
  **I want real-time transcripts!**
- No transcripts by default = no history

And finally, **"Call" per se** - a 145-years old concept required to keep the wires connected. Let's bury it.

<h3>So it's mostly the same issues:</h2>

- Negotiate the time you start the discussion
- You either join or miss it completely
- No recording by default, no transcript retained
- No way to easily review what's happened if you join late
- No built-in way to follow-up once it ends
- Do you really bother to see all these faces,
  or just the one(s) talking?
