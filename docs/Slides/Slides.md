Pay close attention to what you see here. 

Yes, it's choosing between two stupid answers, solving a f@cking captcha, and "play mini-games and relax"!

**According to Google, this is the #1 solution to a real problem most of us face every day.<br/><br/>And 3.8 stars is an ok rating!**

See any problems?
- Barcodes vs transcripts.
- Stop recording to "send" it - that's why you can't use audio messages to talk in real-time.
- No listen mode: the player stops once it reaches the end, it won't auto-play any new voice messages. BUT it doesn't stop when you start recording :)
- No audio time span concept: similarly to chat messages, they're dots, not spans. So no matter how many people talk simultaneously, you hear them in order
- No text-to-speech, no context change detection to auto-stop recording, etc...
