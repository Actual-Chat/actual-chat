## Prerequisites

Install:

- [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- `dotnet workload install wasm-tools`  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [NodeJS 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the latest `npm`;
  [npm-windows-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-windows-upgrade)
  is the simplest way to update `npm` on Windows
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge#platform)
  or [Chrome](https://chromeenterprise.google/browser/download/)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro/#installation)
- [Configure GCP service key](https://www.notion.so/actual-chat/GCP-service-keys-d4cbb93a014644fba636e35aad45f94d)
- Ensure your time & timezone settings are correct.

Run:
```bash
dotnet tool restore
dotnet workload install wasm-tools
dotnet workload install maui
```

Recommended IDEs:
- [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Building Server + Web App

First, get Google Cloud credentials (`key.json` file) to make sure you can use Google Transcribe APIs. Copy the provided file to `~/.gcp/key.json` and ensure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env. variable stores its path.

To build & run the project:

```bash
# Start Docker containers for NGINX, PostgreSQL, Redis etc.
./docker-start.cmd

# Install dependencies and run watch (dotnet watch + webpack watch)
./run-build.cmd restore-tools npm-install watch
```

If you're getting `RpcException` with 
`"Request had invalid authentication credentials."` message,
make sure your time & time zone settings are correct.

Other useful commands:

```powershell
# What else build project can do?
./run-build.cmd --help
 
# List all available targets (you can combine them)
./run-build.cmd --list-targets

# Run with observability services (opentelemetry collector + jaeger) locally:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.observability.yml -f docker-compose.yml up

# Use either env. var or the matching option in your appsettings.local.json
$env:HostSettings__OpenTelemetryEndpoint="localhost"
./run-build.cmd watch
```

You can add your own targets (as C# code) to `./build/Program.cs`, which is actually a [Bullseye](https://github.com/adamralph/bullseye) build project written in C#.

It's also useful to have an [alias](https://github.com/vchirikov/dotfiles/blob/7f280e9287ceba6fd508577fb0665fc19e4d9b29/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1#L231-L249) to run build system (to run commands like `bs watch`).

There are some shortcuts in `*.cmd` files, you can use them too.

Possible issues:
- If you use Windows, project build could break with a message about some resource related to `AdamE.Firebase.iOS.Analytics` package is not found. The issue is because of well-known default 260 characters limitation on the path length. Fortunately, there is a [workaround](https://github.com/AdamEssenmacher/GoogleApisForiOSComponents?tab=readme-ov-file#long-path-issue-workarounds) to make it working.

## Accessing Web App

NGINX (which runs in Docker) is configured to serve the app + its assets from https://local.actual.chat, which means you need to setup a few extra things to access it.

### Setting up https://local.actual.chat

Run:
```bash
./add-hosts.cmd
```

Alternatively, you  hosts and trust certificate manually:

- Add this line with aliases to [Hosts file](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/).
     ```
     127.0.0.1  local.actual.chat media.local.actual.chat cdn.local.actual.chat
     ```
 - Import [local.actual.chat.crt](./.config/local.actual.chat/ssl/local.actual.chat.crt) to "Trusted Root Certification Authorities". You can do it with [Microsoft Management Console](https://www.thesslstore.com/knowledgebase/ssl-install/how-to-import-intermediate-root-certificates-using-mmc/#import-root-certificate-using-mmc12/) or [Chrome](https://www.pico.net/kb/how-do-you-get-chrome-to-accept-a-self-signed-certificate/).

## Building Mobile and Desktop Apps

The instructions below imply you're on Windows.

### Windows app

- Install [sign_app.cer](./.config/maui/sign_app.cer) to "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" (required only once).
- Build solution:
  - using any IDE, or:
  - run `msbuild` from repo root, or,
  - run `dotnet build` from repo root.
- Run this command from repo root:
  ```bash
  dotnet publish src/dotnet/App.Maui/App.Maui.csproj -f net8.0-windows10.0.22000.0 -c Debug-MAUI --no-restore -p:GenerateAppxPackageOnBuild=true -p:AppxPackageSigningEnabled=true -p:PackageCertificateThumbprint=0BFF799D82CC03E61A65584D31D800924149453A
  ```  

Possible issues:
- `"artefacts\obj\ClientApp\project.assets.json' doesn't have a target for 'net7.0-windows10.0.22000.0"` error: try to build everything in IDE and run `dotnet publish` with `--no-restore`.

### Android app

TODO: write this section.

## Conventions

We use:
- [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Standard .NET naming & style guidelines. Exceptions:
    - Place `{` on the same line for `if`, `for`, and
      any other code inside method body
    - If you have to wrap a method body expression,
      wrap it before `=>` rather than after
    - A bunch of other things, see `#coding-style` Discord channel

## Releases

We use [Nerdbank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning/blob/master/doc/nbgv-cli.md).

To publish a new release, run these commands from repo root:

```bash
dotnet nbgv prepare-release
# Push newly created version XX:
git push --set-upstream origin release/v0.XX
```

Note that release deployment won't happen unless approved by one of our core team members.

We use the `alpha` suffix in the `master` branch, `beta`,`rc-*` in release branches. When a release branch drops the version suffix it becomes a production release.
