## Conventions

We use:
- [Conventional commit](shttps://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Standard .NET naming & style guidelines. Exceptions:
    - Place `{` on the same line for `if`, `for`, and
      any other code inside method body
    - If you have to wrap a method body expression,
      wrap it before `=>` rather than after
